title : 東北
description : North-East Japan (or Tohoku) is a large, beautiful rural region that is known for its delicious fruit. Yet this region is also home to few Christians. There are many towns and villages here with no church or missionary presence. We desire this region to bare much spiritual fruit! In Japan, and this region in particular, Jesus’ words definitely ring true. The harvest is plentiful but the workers are few. (Matthew 9.37)
description2 : North-East Japan was also hit by the major 2011 earthquakes and tsunami which killed around 18,000 people and destroyed whole towns and cities along the coast. Today, the people are rebuilding their lives. It will take generations for the sense of loss and pain felt by the people here to disappear.
