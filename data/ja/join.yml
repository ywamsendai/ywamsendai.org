title1 : Long-Term
content1 : If you feel you may be called to Japan, and if you are willing to drop everything and follow the leading of Holy Spirit to love the Japanese, then we would love to have you join us on staff! Find more info on joining our team on our Wiki (click the button below). Get in touch and we will guide you through the process to join the team.
title2 : Short-Term Volunteers & Teams
content2 : Are you interested in volunteering with us short-term, or bringing an outreach team? That's great! You are welcome! As we are still a new and small community, we are unable to plan schedules or ministries for outreach teams. But you are welcome to prayer walk, do evangelism, and get involved in things we do regularly as a community! Individual volunteers will have a taste of what it is like to be a long-term team member with us. Please get in touch on social networks or email (form below) and ask us any questions you have about coming to Sendai! :)
