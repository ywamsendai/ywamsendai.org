  title : Authentic Japanese Christianity
  content : Japanese identity is deeply entangled with Shinto and Buddhist culture and customs. Christianity often looks and feels Western, so the Japanese tend to view it as being a “Western religion”. Its common to hear someone say “I really like Jesus, but I am Japanese.” For the gospel to truly take root in Japan, we need to communicate the gospel in a Japanese way. As a community, we desire to linguistically and culturally function in both English and Japanese. We desire to creatively explore ways in which we can express Christian worship in authentically Japanese ways.

  title : Christian Unity
  content : Churches and mission organisations in Japan struggle to communicate, pray for, and work with each other. But we believe that Christian unity holds the key to true revival in Japan. Therefore, we wish to actively seek relationship with believers from every church and mission organisation. We want our lifestyle and work to reflect our desire for Christian unity. Having said that, we must not be afraid to offend the ‘status-quo’ and be all that God wants us to be. This is because we also believe we are called to radically live out the Bible in 21st-century Japan- however way that looks!

  title : A Mission Hub
  content : With a population of over a million people, Sendai is the largest city in North-East Japan. We desire to see a community of people established in this city that will love God and make Him known to the 99% of the population that don’t yet know Him. As Tohoku is a large region that is mostly unreached by the gospel, we want to see a YWAM community pioneered in all of the six prefectures. Therefore, it is our heart to not only grow as a community in Sendai, but also to champion and release our members to spread God’s work through YWAM in surrounding areas!
