  title : Authentic Japanese Christianity
  content : Japanese identity is deeply entangled with Shinto and Buddhist culture and customs. Christianity often looks and feels Western, so the Japanese tend to view it as being a “Western religion”. Its common to hear someone say “I really like Jesus, but I am Japanese.” We long for this to change! For the gospel to truly take root in Japan, we need to communicate the gospel in a Japanese way. As a community, we desire to function bilingually in English and Japanese, as well as being culturally fluent. We desire to creatively explore ways in which we can express worship and evangelism in authentically Japanese ways.

  title : A Mission Hub
  content : With a population of over a million people, Sendai is the largest city in North-East Japan. We desire to see a community of people established in this city that will love God and make Him known to the 99% of the population that don’t yet know Him. As Tohoku is a large region that is mostly unreached by the gospel, we want to see a YWAM community pioneered in all of the six prefectures. Therefore, it is our heart to not only grow as a community in Sendai, but also to champion and release our members to spread God’s work through YWAM in surrounding areas!
